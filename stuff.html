<p>Sometimes I make things. These are some projects I managed to finish:</p>
<small>(Please note, I'm terrible at naming stuff)</small>

	I've played with FL Studio from 2016 to 2019; this is the result. I may or may not continue to do so.

	<h3>Untitled Nº 58</h3>
		<p><i>(I told you I'm bad at names)</i></p>
		<p>My most recent musical project, and one of the two or three that I actually like. Though, I left it unfinished; hence the name, Untitled Nº 58. The final version is supposed to have lyrics and be performed on real instruments, somthing I doubt I'll do any time soon, which I feel is kind of a shame and a waste. Anyways, never say never; I <i>might</i> do it some day in the future.</p>

	<h3>Ice cold</h3>
		<p>An attempt to make a trap beat... It's kind of bland, not punchy, call it whatever... I'll put it here because it's something I at least finished.</p>
		<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/361170617&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false"></iframe>

	<h3>De música ligera (ft. Jorge Loquendo)</h3>
		<p>A parody song, where I replaced the original singer with one of the Loquendo voices. For context, Loquendo is a Text To Speech software (like the Google Translate voice) that was very popular in the "early" and "not-so-early" days of latin-american Youtube. Although it was a bit tedius to "correct" the pitch of the voice and it isn't perfect, it was a fun project to make.</p>

	<h3>Backtracking</h3>
		<p>An electro-swing song except I made a melody instead of sampling another track, so I don't know if it still counts as electro-swing... maybe it does, idk.</p>
		<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/346329784&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false"></iframe>

	<h3>Slowing down</h3>
		<p>Lo-Fi Hip Hop, again, without the use of samples.</p>
		<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/325949764&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false"></iframe>

	<h3>Burpstep</h3>
		<p>One of my really old, first tracks. It's a short dubstep song. I had a longer version in progress at the time, but I've lost it long ago, which is a shame because I like this one too.</p>
		<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/312436788&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false"></iframe>

	<h3>Futurist ad</h3>
		<p>This is my very first track, but it doesn't make me cringe as hard as I thought it would have (except maybe for the titlle). So that's something.</p>
