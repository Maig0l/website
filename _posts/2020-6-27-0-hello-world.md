So, after _one and a half YEARS_ I finally got my shit together and set up the website I wanted to build for a long time.

What am I going to post here? Anything I do that I find a _bit_ worth sharing.
For example, I want to learn many things (programming, pixel-art, japanese, etc) and it might be a good idea to keep a record of my progress here.

This time I really want to get to actually post stuff regularly.
So, if you'd like to to follow along with my "progress" and other dumb stuff I might want to say, just add the [Atom feed](/feed.xml) to your aggregator :P
